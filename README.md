So, this time the data is among the TOP 100 rated movies on the IMDB platform.

Films: (1931-2023) - These years are included and it is known that they belong to 10 different countries in general.

Here, I conducted research on 4 categories: 

1) Among the Top 100 IMDB movies: Average Ratings on Countries. The country that takes the first place in the rating table is "United Kingdom" with 8.61 times. Then, "Italy" takes the 2nd place and "United States" takes the 3rd place.

2) Among the Top 100 IMDB movies: Number of movie releases by country.                                                                                                                                               In this table, "United States" maintained its leadership with a record number of movies, "77". It is the "United Kingdom" that does not follow it very closely but has decided on the 2nd place. The third place is occupied by the movie "6" and "Japan".

3) Among the top 100 IMDB movies: Average rating over the years.                                                                                                                                                     In this table, we see "1972" as the most auspicious movie year, with an average rating of "9.20". This movie also belongs to the "United States" and was shot in the "Crime, Drama" genre. This movie is, in my opinion, the movie "The Godfather" that is familiar to everyone.

4) Among the top 100 IMDB movies: Among the many movie genres,                                                                                                                                                       
it is interesting that the 1st place is occupied by the "Drama" genre with exactly "8" movies. The 2nd place is occupied by the movies "Crime" and "Drama" with the number "7", which are not very different. The third place is occupied by "Action, Adventure and Drama" with the number "5".

 Generally speaking, most of the lucky movies are in the drama genre.
